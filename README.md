# Gang War Sandbox
A mod for Grand Theft Auto V that allows players to immerse themselves into a battlefield.

# A Quick Note
This mod is very poorly written (atleast in many parts). In the beginning, it was just something quick to mess around with, and then I had a vision for it and I wanted it to be something real. So in the time from the start to that realization, the code I wrote is very poor. I will try to rewrite much of it, but the core functionality is most important to me. A little tech debt never hurt anybody :)
